 2 virtual doms created by diff algo consumes memory? how is it faster then the code we write using normal HTML CSS Js?

React makes it faster and having 2 virtual doms is not necessarily bad as it takes a very less memory. 
like you can take useState example if the same thing is made using HTML and js we need to write loop statements 
and it can take performance hit so it makes it slow compared to react. 
and moreover js will only implement code but not necessarily updates UI but react does both at a time hence it is faster
