DOM elements- HTML tags
similarly we have react elements(object)

eg of react element
const heading=React.createElement("h1",{id:"heading},"Namaste React");

React.createElement creates a React element which is this object, when we render this object it becomes html object

const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementbyId("root"));
root.render(heading);

--------------------------------------------
very clumsy way to write html inside js

thus we can write react code without jsx
JSX is different react is different


jsx is not html inside JSX
jsx is html like syntax
const jsxHeading=<h1>heeellooooo</h1> returnss object
this is not pure js and won't be run by Es6 engine

but parcel(babel) transpiles(converts into a form which is understood by ES engine) the code before it reaches the ES engine

JSX is converted to react element(by babel)which gives a JS object which is rendered as HTMl element

babel creates Abstract tree(refer JS notes)

attributes inside jsx are written in camel case
